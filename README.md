# Neovim Configuration

This is a modern Neovim configuration built from the ground up in Lua, specifically tailored for competitive programming. It's designed to be fast, lightweight, and packed with features to make you more efficient during contests.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Plugin Manager**: Uses [`packer.nvim`](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) for fast, declarative plugin management.
* **Theme**: Beautiful and easy on the eyes, featuring the popular [`gruvbox.nvim`](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim) theme.
* **File Explorer**: A powerful file tree powered by [`nvim-tree.lua`](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua) for quick navigation.
* **IDE-like Experience**: Full Language Server Protocol (LSP) support via [`nvim-lspconfig`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) and [`mason.nvim`](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) for easy language server installation.
    * Autocompletion provided by [`nvim-cmp`](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp).
    * Support for C, C++, and Java out of the box.
* **Advanced Syntax Highlighting**: Uses [`nvim-treesitter`](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) for more accurate and intelligent code highlighting.
* **Automatic Templating**: Automatically populates new C++ files with your custom competitive programming template.
* **Quality of Life**:
    * `lualine.nvim`: A sleek and informative statusline.
    * `nvim-autopairs`: Automatically closes brackets, quotes, etc.
    * `luasnip`: For custom snippets.
